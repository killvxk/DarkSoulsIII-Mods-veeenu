# Dark Souls III Mods

Here you can find some utilities intended to aid in practicing Dark Souls III speedrunning in the least dreadful way possible.

This repository contains the source code for all the tools. 

You can download executable versions of the tools under the **Releases** tab.

## List of tools

### PracTeleport

[Download](https://github.com/veeenu/DarkSoulsIII-Mods/releases/download/0.0.3-alpha/PracTeleport.zip)

A CheatEngine trainer that allows you to save your current position (by pressing `F4`) and restore it later (by pressing `F5`). 

You can also toggle an *unlimited iframes* script by pressing `F6`, and *deathcam* by pressing `F7`.
Soon, in one of the next releases, hotkeys will be made configurable.

This tool is intended to practice position-based skips, such as:

- *Farron Keep Skip*: you can save your position near the spot and teleport back there immediately if you die
- *Irithyll Skip*: save your position before jumping, teleport back when you fall on the other side
- *Scream Skip*: save your position on firm ground, quickly teleport back if you risk falling off and dying
- *Wolf Skip*: return back to the original jump spot if you misalign the jump
- *Angel Skip*: avoid having to run all the way back if you fail the jump

Just open Dark Souls III, run the executable and you're good to go.
